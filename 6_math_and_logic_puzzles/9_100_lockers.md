What does it means for a door to be toggled?
* Question: for which rounds is a door toggled(open or closed)?
    * A door is toggled for each favtor of n. Ex: if n=15, the door is toggled in rounds 1,3,5,15.

* Question: When a door will be left open?
    * A door is left open if the number of factors(which we will call x) is odd. You can think of it by pairing factors off as an open and a close, if there is one remaining, the locker will remain open. Ex n=15 (1,15),(3,5) so the door stays close.

* Question: When would x be odd?
    * The x is odd if n is a peferct square. For example n=36 (1,36),(2,18)(3,12)(4,9)(6,6). As the last pair is the same number in both factors, the total number of different factors is odd, which left the door closed.

* How many perfect squares are in 100?
    * There are 10 perfect squares, you can count them (1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100). So 10 lockers will be left open.
